Each test scenario is accompanied by corresponding Python step definitions that simulate interactions with the system under test-such as clicking a button or verifying UI output. This setup enables scalable, repeatable testing of LLM-generated user interfaces or functionality against expected behavior.

    "Dataset Description": "Dataset Construction. We obtain a list of target entities by referencing the list of LobbyMap (lobbymap.org), a platform that evaluates corporate engagement in climate policy. We initially retrieve up to 30 videos per company by searching ads on each corporate official YouTube channel, resulting in a total of 720 videos (some channels did not have 30 videos available). We wanted to collect a wide range of advertising-like content from companies, and did not want to limit videos to specific product promotions or TV commercials. At the same time, videos that were clearly not advertising-like were excluded during the annotation process, ensuring the quality of the annotated dataset. Next, we randomly sample 500 videos for annotation. Videos that are deleted or clearly not ads (e.g., earnings calls) are excluded, leaving a final set of 386 annotated videos. Annotation guidelines are refined over multiple rounds, achieving a final Fleiss' Kappa Video resolution varies (e.g., 398x224, 400x400) based on the original content, and all videos are in MP4 format, including audio (though some videos lack original audio tracks). The following is an example object of each line of the file: Note that anonymization is applied only in this paper; the actual released dataset maintains the original information. In the FACEBOOK domain, there may be cases where video content and labels do not perfectly align, because the original labels were created mainly for textual content. To evaluate this, one of the authors manually annotated 20 randomly selected videos based only on videos, comparing them with the original labels. F-score between the original annotations and our manual video-based annotations was 83%, suggesting that the distant labels are still reasonable quality. We stored the dataset in a JSON Lines file, with each line containing metadata including video ID, URL, published date, entity name, video length in seconds, entity's headquarter country and region, channel name and ID, and video view count, in addition to annotated labels.

MLEB consists of ten expert-annotated datasets spanning multiple jurisdictions (the US, UK, EU, Australia, Ireland, and Singapore), document types (cases, legislation, regulatory guidance, contracts, and literature), and task types (search, zero-shot classification, and question answering). Seven of the datasets in MLEB were newly constructed in order to fill domain and jurisdictional gaps in the open-source legal information retrieval landscape. We document our methodology in building MLEB and creating the new constituent datasets, and release our code, results, and data openly to assist with reproducible evaluations. To that end, MLEB contains ten different evaluation sets spanning a range of difficulties (including tasks requiring legal reasoning as well as tasks requiring lexical analysis), problem types (specifically, retrieval, zero-shot classification, and question answering), jurisdictions (the US, UK, EU, Australia, Ireland, and Singapore), and document types (decisions, legislation, regulatory guidance, contracts, and literature). Of the ten datasets in MLEB, seven are entirely new, constructed either by having subject matter experts hand-label data or by adapting existing expert-labeled data.

    "Dataset Description": "ORBIT benchmark, leaderboard, and codebase are available at www.open-reco-bench.ai. Some are constructed without explicit user consent, raising ethical and legal concerns To construct ClueWeb-Reco, we first collect raw user histories in modern browsers through established human research platforms with explicit consent and carefully-designed quality control filters to remove noisy entries such as scams and inappropriate content. When aggregated, these seemingly innocuous signals can inadvertently reveal subjects' PII To mitigate such risks and to mimic real-world webpage recommendation setup of recommending from a web corpus in terms of browsing sequence behavior, we replace each valid URL in the raw collected dataset with its most similar page in the English subset of ClueWeb22-B (ClueWeb22-B EN) To perform this transformation, we apply a semantic soft matching pipeline based on retrieval. Specifically, for each collected URL, we identify its most relevant document in ClueWeb22-B EN by computing semantic similarity using dense embeddings. As illustrated in Figure Figure This final, released ClueWeb-Reco dataset consists of interaction sequences in terms of ClueWeb22-B EN document (webpage) IDs and is released under the MIT license. Note that to access the content (URLs, titles, full contents, etc) of these webpages, one must sign a license agreement to obtain the research-only ClueWeb22 dataset ORBIT covers limited models and datasets, with plans to incorporate more public datasets and recent LLM-based recommenders like LLM2Rec ClueWeb-Reco currently focuses on U.S. • Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.

It provides additional information about the attributes of the two groups -stereotypical and non-stereotypical, allowing the model to answer without resorting to the \"Unknown\" option.

Scoring is done by determining the quality score on a scale of 1-5, where 1 indicates a path which is completely unrelated to the question and answer, and 5 indicates an explicit answer to the question. From our final benchmark we filter out all paths rated 1-3, which we deem as low-quality and leave only paths rated 4-5 as high-quality ones.",

    "Dataset Description": "During collection, approximately 14 million remote sensing images were retrieved from VersaD, covering several public repositories-including MillionAID The dataset should cover a broader range of remote sensing scenes, include images with spatial resolutions, and provide more detailed captions. This suggests that these categories were not effectively aligned with textual labels during the pretraining phase, thereby negatively impacting the model performance on these classes. Additionally, categories such as \"parking lot\" and \"parking space\" were often indistinguishable, indicating a lack of finegrained attribute information in the training data. As a result, the model tends to recognize only the general concept of \"parking,\" without the ability to differentiate between more specific subcategories. Therefore, future efforts in dataset construction should aim to incorporate a wider variety of remote sensing scenarios along with detailed attribute-level annotations, in order to enhance the model capability to distinguish among closely related classes.

    "Dataset Description": "Relevant textual information for each task was systematically extracted from the original datasets and integrated using standardized templates. For instance, the required text fields were distilled from the whole EHR database and then condensed into structured inputs with templates (e.g., \"Chief Complaint: ..., Examination: ...\"). Additionally, for tasks introducing structured metadata (e.g., demographic information and examination results), we transformed these structured features into explicitly labeled textual forms, integrating them seamlessly with clinical notes. The template for input and output can be found in Supplementary Section 4.1.

Next, the Planner semantically matches each synopsis to its corresponding visual asset and generates a binary-tree layout, allocating panels by estimated content length while preserving reading order and spatial balance. Finally, the Painter-Commenter loop refines each panel: the Painter distills section-figure pairs into concise bullet points and renders draft panels via python-pptx code, and the Commenter-a VLM with zoom-in reference prompts-provides targeted feedback to correct text overflow and spatial alignment. This top-down, visual-in-the-loop design produces concise, coherent posters without manual tuning.

    "Dataset Description": "The Chrono-Text module temporally anchors generated textual tokens by incorporating additional tokens (markers) that explicitly encode time, ensuring alignment between words and visual frames. TempoVoice is a controllable, online text-to-speech module designed to produce synchronized audio from these temporally annotated textual embeddings, ensuring accurate synchronization between audio and facial reactions. In addition, we construct a high-quality dataset named ResponseNet, comprising 696 dyadic conversation pairs. Each pair includes synchronized split-screen video streams of both speaker and listener, multichannel audio recordings, verbatim text transcriptions, and detailed facial-behavior annotations (i.e., facial expressions and head movements). Through extensive retrieval for scarce dyadic video data, rigorous content filtering, meticulous camera-shift alignment, and manual annotation, ResponseNet delivers a unique and valuable resource for benchmarking OMCRG. To align predicted and ground-truth facial dynamics, we apply an ℓ 2 reconstruction loss on the listener's feature embeddings: Audio Generation Loss. The audio loss operates over discrete semantic tokens A l µ , indexed by µ, which correspond to frame indices t = µk (k is the downsampling factor). We maximize the likelihood of each token conditioned on previous audio semantics and the listener's hidden states: where H t-k+1:t denotes the model's hidden representations for the corresponding listener text tokens Ŵl t-k+1:t . This formulation ensures coherent alignment across modalities throughout generation. We conducted a user study with 49 participants (28 male, 21 female",

BBOPlace-Bench decouples problem formulation, optimization algorithm, and evaluation, offering a flexible framework that allows users to easily implement and test their BBO algorithms, with the hope of facilitating the application of BBO, as well as better solving the significant problem of chip placement. One limitation of this paper is that we used the commercial software Cadence Innovus for PPA evaluation. We plan to integrate open-source EDA tools (e.g., OpenROAD Based on our empirical findings, several promising directions emerge for advancing BBO for chip placement, each addressing critical challenges in the field: • Multi-objective optimization.",

    "Dataset Description": "In this work, we introduce CRADLE BENCH, a benchmark for multi-faceted crisis detection. Unlike previous efforts that focus on a limited set of crisis types, our benchmark covers seven types defined in line with clinical standards and is the first to incorporate temporal labels. Our benchmark provides 600 clinicianannotated evaluation examples and 420 development examples, together with a training corpus of around 4K examples automatically labeled using a majority-vote ensemble of multiple language models, which significantly outperforms single-model annotation. When both labels could apply, ongoing takes precedence to reflect clinical priority. Building on the high-quality labels produced by the ensemble method in Section 4.3, we develop and release LLMs specialized for mental health crisis detection. To construct the training data, we adopt majority voting among GPT-5, Claude-4-Sonnet, and Gemini-2.5-Pro to automatically annotate the dataset. As shown in Table • Unanimous subset where all three models agree (3,058 instances, 3,257 lables) • Consensus subset where at least two models agree (4,181 instances, 4,649 labels) We fine-tune three open-source LLMs as base models: Qwen3-14B, chosen for its competitive performance relative to model size. We also select Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, which demonstrate strong overall results on CRADLE BENCH. All models are fine-tuned on the training sets described above.

    "Dataset Description": "To investigate this idea, we elaborated and implemented two strategies for the service S using LLMs. We aimed for a use case that, at the same time, reflected a production interoperability scenario and was not too trivial. For a production use case, we mean data formats and schemas that are used in practice; as for triviality, we refer to scenarios where the data schema is too simple (as in the example that illustrates Section 3.1). Based on these criteria, we have selected a use case from the agricultural domain. In agriculture, field data is a core asset, including the field name, its geographic boundaries, the crop type, the crop maturity, and the soil humidity level, among various other attributes As we reviewed the dataset generation procedure, we identified a problem when we created the dataset v4: we performed multiple float point conversions among the different units in the dataset preparation process, which led to losing the precision of the numbers. For this reason, we regenerated the dataset v4 performing only one unit conversion (from the input unit to the expected unit) and re-run the experiment on this dataset.",

We again take the survey example but assume that sex is not recorded in this case; this gives us a scenario where it is hard to account for bias introduced by the missing participants' responses. For BO an entire subset of data is missing for several features during several timesteps. This type of missingness is particularly present in time-series and multimodal datasets, where entire modalities can be missing.

    "Dataset Description": "Through this rigorous process, we construct PsyCoTalk, the first large-scale dialogue dataset supporting comorbidity, containing 3,000 multi-turn diagnostic dialogues validated by psychiatrists. This dataset enhances diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning, offering a valuable resource for psychiatric comorbidity research. Compared to real-world clinical transcripts, PsyCoTalk exhibits high structural and linguistic fidelity in terms of dialogue length, token distribution, and diagnostic reasoning strategies. This dataset enables the development and evaluation of models capable of multi-disorder psychiatric screening in a single conversational pass. 1 DSM-5 is the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders by the American Psychiatric Association. It provides standardized criteria for diagnosing mental disorders and is used to ensure accuracy and consistency. It supports two strategies: random shuffle or symptom-informed mode, which prioritizes modules based on current symptoms. • ResponseClassifier(conv) → bool: Classifies the patient's latest answer as present or absent and forwards this label to the HDSM to trigger state transitions. • NeedExpBranch(conv) → node: Decides whether to enter the \"Experience Inquiry\" branch of the context tree based on the previous turn's content. Each conversation averages 45.9 turns, nearly double other corpora. Utterance lengths are 34.0 characters (doctors) and 43.5 (patients), closest to real clinical conversations To verify the effectiveness of the fictitious personal experience module under EMR reuse and to validate the cross-lingual generalization of our pipeline, we assess dialogue diversity and conduct a small-scale English generation experiment compared with existing corpora; detailed metrics and results are reported in Appendix A.2. To assess diagnostic accuracy, we use initial EMR labels as ground truth and evaluate with exactmatch (all 5 disorders correct).

The E3VQA benchmark is constructed utilizing the large-scale synchronized ego-exo dataset, Ego-Exo4D • Ego2Exo: Agent F 2 first generates a scene graph using only I ego , which is then sequentially expanded by incorporating information from I exo to generate scene graph S 2 . • Exo2Ego: Agent F 3 follows the reverse approach, generating a scene graph based solely on I exo and subsequently supplementing it with I ego to generate scene graph S 3 . Together, the three agents can capture both view-specific details and holistic scene context from complementary perspectives. For each perspective, prompts are carefully designed to capture the complementary information present in the ego-exo images. Please refer to Appendix E.2 for the complete prompts.

    "Dataset Description": "First, we introduce LocalEval, a comprehensive benchmark comprising over 40 tasks organized into four categories: service fundamentals, spatiotemporal context, user interaction, and composite tasks. Our fundamental approach involves designing question-answer templates to structure this information. We provide objective information dimensions to our template generation agent, which creates templates for organizing the information into question-answer pairs. For example, given input categories of merchant name, description, and self-reported business category, the Template Agent generates templates like: \"Instruction: A merchant named {name} with selfdescription {introduction}, what is their business category? Output: The merchant belongs to {category}.\" To ensure data diversity and coverage, we design multiple information input combinations and instruct the agent to generate at least 10 templates with different sentence patterns for each combination. We sample merchants and users, organizing their original information according to these templates to form the first component of LocalInstruction. This template-based approach enables efficient, cost-effective generation of large-scale training data.",

Detailed annotation guidelines are provided in Appendix E. Specifically, we recruited 12 annotators with bachelor's degrees or above for the first stage, and 8 annotators with legal educational background for the second stage. The inter-annotator agreement rates achieved during the pilot annotations were 88% and 80% for the first and second stages respectively, indicating substantial consistency in the annotation process. For each dialogue, we paid annotators 8 CNY in stage-1 and 9 CNY in stage-2. The total annotation cost amounted to 63,360 CNY ($8,751 at an exchange rate of 7.24 CNY/USD). In this section, we present comprehensive statistics of our constructed dataset, followed by an analysis of data distribution.

Second, legal experts conducted thorough content reviews to filter out potentially discriminatory, violent, or offensive content, while ensuring anonymity and mitigating potential biases. Furthermore, we release LeCoDe under a license restricted to academic research purposes only (see in Appendix A.2). We believe these measures effectively mitigate potential social risks.

Apart from the microscopic high-frequency noise, we observe a macroscopic shape deformation in many of the generated point cloud (see Figure Here, we apply a kNN search on the reference frame to construct local neighbor pairs, then penalize changes in distance between these pairs. By combining reconstruction and rigidity loss, we enhance the generation quality of the 3D point cloud, as shown in Figure",

The dataset captures several driving sequences in rainy conditions in a rural Australian area, addressing the lack of such data in the autonomous driving community. Although Panoptic-CUDAL offers extensive coverage of challenging rural scenarios, our findings reveal several areas that warrant further research. Due to the nature of rural settings, certain road users, such as cyclists and motorcyclists, are rarely seen.

    "Dataset Description": "In summary, our main contributions are as follows: • We introduce mmWalk, a novel multi-view and multi-modal dataset specifically designed for inclusive walking assistance, encompassing synchronized frame data from walker, guide dog, and drone perspectives with comprehensive modalities (RGB, depth, semantic segmentation), contextual metadata, and a large size (over 559K images). Cross-evaluation on the real-world dataset proves that VLMs obtain significant benefits by fine-tuning on the established mmWalk dataset. VQA Generation. We randomly sample 7570 frames among all trajectories for mmWalkVQA generation from the mmWalk dataset. We then used GPT-4o to generate the VQA pairs in batches. The overall workflow of VQA generation is shown in Figure In terms of scene information extraction, we kept the RGB images in all views, adhering to our multi-view concept, while translating the semantic segmentation and depth images into a list of strings describing object positions in a BLVfriendly clockwise manner Those are fed into ChatGPT-4o to generate VQA pairs. VQA Filtration and Validation. To ensure high data quality, we first applied automatic filtering to remove low-quality VQA pairs by identifying manually defined keywords in questions and answers, such as Unknown, not possible, etc., as illustrated at the bottom of Figure 4 Model Benchmarking",

    "Dataset Description": "Here, the continuity of the gray shape's curve is split into two competing \"wholes\": one resembling two faces (due to the brain's bias for face-like patterns) and one resembling a goblet (due to the brain's bias for object-like patterns). This split creates the illusion of simultaneous, conflicting interpretations. In short, the image leverages one contour's ability to fit two familiar shapes (faces + goblet) and the brain's innate tendency to prioritize familiar, evolutionarily important shapes (like faces) to create a multistable, ambiguous perception.

    "Dataset Description": "Finally, practical validation was performed by evaluating the occluded data on three downstream perception tasks, as shown in Table Moreover, to assess their perceptual impact and ensure reproducibility, we computed the mean Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) The mean SSIM drops for dirt were 0.43, 0.73, and 0.88, while for water-blur they were 0.28, 0.29, and 0.45 at occlusion levels 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3, respectively. For scratches, the mean drop was 0.34, computed over randomly applied patterns of varying severities. For WoodScape soiling patterns, it was 0.074, obtained by randomly applying kernels of different sizes (15×15, 51×51, 101×101, and 251×251) across images. The relatively small SSIM drop for the WoodScape soiling effect reflects its translucent, low-opacity nature, which simulates subtle lens haze rather than strong occlusion. Together, these checks establish the validity and quality of the occluded nuScenes dataset, ensuring it is both reliable for research and impactful for evaluating perception robustness in automated driving.",

Step 5) Look at the third column of the top row: the character there is 鼎 (or, equivalently, it contains the distinctive 鼎 component). By the rule, the question-mark position must also contain 鼎. Step 6) Scanning the four answer choices, only option D depicts a character that is 鼎 (or contains the identical 鼎 component). Hence option D satisfies the pattern and is the correct answer. Step 1) Note that the figures are arranged in a 3 × 3 grid with the bottom-right position marked by a question mark. \\nStep 2) For every figure, count the number of intersection points where two or more lines cross.\\nStep 3) Reading the eight given figures from left-to-right, top-to-bottom, the intersection counts are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, forming a simple arithmetic sequence that increases by 1 each time.\\nStep 4) The missing ninth figure must therefore contain 9 intersections to continue the sequence.\\nStep 5) Among the four answer choices, only option D contains exactly 9 intersection points; the others contain different counts.\\nStep 6) Hence the correct answer is D. -A visual reasoning question, -A step-by-step chain-of-thought reasoning to justify the answer, -A list of step labels (e.g., \"Step 1\", ..., \"Step n\", \"None of the steps are incorrect\").

    "Dataset Description": "We add a prompt x (see Section C) to the interaction history that contains general instructions such as ignoring aspects such as delivery time or pricing, and encode aversions of the user. With this process, we obtain a set of five user preferences P (t) u for each timestep t based on past interactions. Importantly, the information contained in the different user preferences in P (t) u is mostly orthogonal, i.e., each preference refers to different items or item properties (see an example in Section C). To verify the quality of the generated preferences, we conduct a manual confirmation study (see Section F). The participants found that around 75% of the generated preferences correctly approximate the user's preferences. A schematic illustration of the preference generation procedure is shown in Fig. ( • The inclusion of user embeddings in TIGER does not yield any significant benefits to downstream performance, as illustrated in Fig.",

In this framework, early decoding decisions are highly critical; for instance, generating \"dates\" or \"locations\" of the crime as the first token may unintentionally steer the decoding process toward irrelevant paths. This has the unintended effect of filtering based on information unrelated to legal relevance, thereby discarding documents that may contain key legal elements while overemphasizing those that happen to include the specific date or location. To address this problem, we construct synthetic examples that begin with legally informative tokens from legal elements using few-shot LLMs. Figure",

    "Dataset Description": "Thus, it is important to define a point on the \"abstraction scale\" at which we wish to discriminate algorithms. Similarly to natural systems, the chosen scale may reveal differing points of similarity, and the properties of algorithms may not be scale-invariant. The transition between these scales is the topic of the area of compiler theory. For this classification task, we utilize K-means clustering with K set to the number of different algorithms present in the dataset for the specific problem. The benefit of utilizing a K-means approach is it can be replicated for data where we don't have ground truth labels (such as output from a large language model, as discussed in section 8.3). Below are the results for utilizing this procedure to cluster the sorting algorithms in our PACD dataset. While only the C-term and M-term are shown, the full EMOC score was utilizing for the clustering. In computing, a program clone refers to creating a duplicate of a program, often involving replicating the program's settings, activities, and even its source code.",

    "Dataset Description": "Here, G refers to the goal conditions of assembling sufficient information to generate comprehensive and accurate responses. S represents the state, capturing the current set of information available, which may encompass queries and any retrieved documents. The initial state corresponds to the input multimodal query, I = S 0 = Q 0 . The MRAG Planning task can thus be framed as a state transition function F that progresses from I toward the goal state through a chain of decisions.",

    "Dataset Description": "For SFT, we frame the error attribution task as a sequence-to-sequence problem, where the LLM is fine-tuned to generate a structured description of the errors when presented with a trajectory log. To create a suitable training set for the LLM, we first transform each raw trajectory and its corresponding attribution map into an instruction-following format. This process yields a pair (x, o) for each sample in our dataset. The input prompt, x, is constructed from a template that provides the model with a clear role, the formal definitions of all error modes in our taxonomy Y, and the full, serialized conversation log derived from τ . The target output, o, is a JSON-formatted string that formally identifies each faulty agent and the corresponding set of error modes. With the training data formatted as (x, o) pairs, the objective is to fine-tune the diagnostic LLM, f θ with parameters θ, to maximize the conditional probability of generating the target output o given the input prompt x. The training objective is thus to minimize the negative log-likelihood over our dataset: L SF T (θ) = -(τ,G(τ ))∈Derror log p θ (o|x).",
