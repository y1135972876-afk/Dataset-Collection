      "full_text": "Our contributions can be summarized as follows: • We introduce Re 3 Dial, which presents a novel perspective to alleviate the scarcity of longturn conversations by automatically building a billion-scale long-turn dialogue corpus via concatenating existing short-turn dialogue.• We propose to train a dense session retriever on massive unlabeled plain dialogue data with contrastive learning to capture the global semantic and discourse relations within multiturn dialogues.We also propose the diversity sampling strategy to improve the diversity and informativeness of the automatically constructed corpus.In the past few years, large-scale pre-training has greatly promoted the progress of the NLP community(Brown et al., 2020).Recently, large-scale pre-training has also become the mainstream approach to building open-domain dialogue models, both in English(Zhang et al., 2019;Roller et al., 2020;Thoppilan et al., 2022)and Chinese(Bao et al., 2020;Zhou et al., 2021;Gu et al., 2022;Wen et al., 2022).Through pre-training on massive dialogue data crawled from public social media, these models exhibit strong conversational ability, significantly outperforming traditional non-pre-trained dialogue models.However, the scarcity of longturn dialogues in the pre-training corpus hinders these models from deriving a better ability to utilize long-range context for modeling multi-turn dialogues during pre-training.To alleviate this issue, we study how to automatically and efficiently build a large-scale long-turn dialogue corpus based on the existing short-turn dialogue corpus.",
